// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/
// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
 // Testing & Integration
// Maintain

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

const analysisOfRequirements = 'This is the second step, you and whoever you are collaboriting with will go over the list the specific goals and features previously done in planning and analize what will be required to achieve those'

const design = 'This is the third step, now that you have done the first two steps you will be able to envision and have a rough layout of how your code will be designed and work.  Often times you will create different sections to write out individual code so you can put it all together in the end.  This makes it a bit more organized and easier to work with'

const implementation = 'This is the fourth step, now that all your planning is done, and you have a rough layout of what you want, you can now begin to write your code and implement it'

const testingAndIntegration = 'This is the fifth step, now that your code is written you can begin to test it.  You will combine all your individual code you have written into the group to see if it will function as a whole.  Often times you will run into erros you must fix.'

const maintain = 'This is the final step, now that your code is all built out and running smooth.  Its is your job to maintain the code and make sure everything is running how it needs to be.  If you run into any errors or bugs down the line, it is your job to find and fix them'
